This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) project bootstrapped with [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:4000/graphql to access the GraphQL API Playground.

You can start querying the API by modifying the resolver functions inside the src/graphql directory. The server auto-restarts as you edit the files.
